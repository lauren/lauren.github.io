This [fascinating lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jD_Si2z9WQ "you tube") on the paradox of choice _[via [video sift](http://www.videosift.com/story.php?id=22504)]_ by [Swarthmore](http://www.swarthmore.edu) professor [Barry Schwartz](http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/) (who also has [a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FParadox-Choice-More-Less-P-S%2Fdp%2F0060005696%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1164849336%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=kenspeckle-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) on the matter) is filled with hilarious insights into the intense neuroses and perfectionism sprouting from the explosion of choices in our culture, like: &#8220;With 100 different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure,&#8221; and &#8220;Some choice is better than none, but it doesn&#8217;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice [&#8230;] I&#8217;m pretty much confident that we have long since passed the point where [more] options improve our welfare.&#8221;

But Schwartz isn&#8217;t the first to advocate voluntary constraints as a path to freedom&mdash;the crazy French [OuLiPo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo "wikipedia article") started dabbling in the delicious literary applications of the paradox of choice in the 1960s. OuLiPo stands for [_Ouvroir de Litt&eacute;rature Potentielle_](http://www.oulipo.net/ "official site [French]"), or &#8220;workshop of potential literature,&#8221; consisting most famously of [Raymond Queneau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Queneau "wikipedia article"), [Georges Perec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Perec "wikipedia article"), and [Italo Calvino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino "wikipedia article").

As wikipedia explains, OuLiPo members liked to use constraints, frequently with some mathematical significance, as &#8220;a means of triggering ideas and inspiration.&#8221; There&#8217;s Queneau&#8217;s [_Hundred Thousand Billion Poems_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Thousand_Billion_Poems "wikipedia article"), a book of ten sonnets (check out this [brilliant javascript version](http://www.bevrowe.info/Poems/QueneauRandom.htm)) with each line on a separate strip of paper, so you can flip the paper to create 10<sup>14</sup> different possible permutations of the lines, each of which is its own sonnet, and Calvino&#8217;s [_The Castle of Crossed Destinies_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Crossed_Destinies "wikipedia article"), in which each part of the story is associated with a tarot card and an arrangement of the cards is provided to encourage readers to arrange the pieces in different orders than the initial linear presentation to get different stories.

Heady, fascinating stuff. Anyway, here&#8217;s Schwartz&#8217;s lecture:
