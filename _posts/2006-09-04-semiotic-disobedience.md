&#8220;Semiotic disobedience&#8221; is my favorite new phrase. The idea belongs to Fordham University&#8217;s [Sonia Katyal](http://law.fordham.edu/ihtml/bio.ihtml?id=766&template=jd "Fordham bio"), and Rob Walker was kind enough to [explain it](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/magazine/03wwln_consumed.html) in the _NYT Magazine_:

> As a term and a concept, semiotic disobedience is a riff on two earlier ideas. One, of course, is civil disobedience. The other is &#8220;semiotic democracy,&#8221; a coinage of John Fiske, a media scholar whose 1987 book &#8220;Television Culture&#8221; described the ways in which audiences create their own interpretations of mass entertainment. Katyal&#8217;s combination, then, refers to the reinvention or subversion of logos and other symbols of commercial persuasion as part of a battle to redefine their meaning in ways that are frankly oppositional.

Brilliant! Walker is proposing the anti-Kinko&#8217;s video game [Disaffected!](http://www.persuasivegames.com/games/game.aspx?game=disaffected) as a prime example thereof, but I think British guerrilla artist [Bansky](http://www.banksy.co.uk/ "official site")&#8216;s now-famous [Paris Hilton CD prank](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5310416.stm "BBC story") is even more ripe for classification as an act of [semiotic disobedience](http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/courses/fall05/ipscholarship/katyal%20-%20semiotic%20disobedience.pdf "Katyal's paper") [pdf].

Bansky&#8217;s stunt is aimed to confront Paris&#8217;s audience with her status as an empty signifier, as _The Guardian_ [so aptly put it](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1813991,00.html) (whether or not it would actually have that effect is a different question). Disaffected!, though I haven&#8217;t played it, sounds more like a light-hearted parody of a customer service relationship infamous for the frustration it brings to all involved&mdash;not exactly something that&#8217;s going to make you rethink your need to make copies or get a poster laminated.
