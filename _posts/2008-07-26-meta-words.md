[Wordsmith.org](http://wordsmith.org/)&#8216;s [A.Word.A.Day](http://wordsmith.org/awad/index.html) e-newsletter has had some awesome themes lately. First, there was [words from the Irish](/blog/2008/06/16/some-words-from-the-irish/) in honor of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday), and this week they sent out five meta-words &mdash; words describing words and language &mdash; along with this great quote from [John Locke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke):

> So difficult it is to show the various meanings and imperfections of words when we have nothing else but words to do it with.
