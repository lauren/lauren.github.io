I like these nifty [knitting](http://goshdarnknit.blogspot.com/2006/09/three-days-to-go.html) [paintings](http://goshdarnknit.blogspot.com/2006/09/two-days-to-go.html) by [Rania Hassan](http://www.raniahassan.com "portfolio site").

[Craft magazine&#8217;s blog](http://www.craftzine.com/blog/archive/2006/09/artist_rania_hassan_and_her_kn.html) has this interesting quote from Rania:

> I am fascinated by the connections we find in our everyday experiences: from the isolation of communities on the subway, to the solitary experience of introspection [&#8230;] My work is about the levels of connectedness we feel. [&#8230;] I am also intrigued by the community I&#8217;ve found online with knitters from around the world. I think about how it links me to my mother, and her mother, and all the women that came before them. 

Reminded me of something my thesis adviser was saying about the shared experience of the isolated activity of reading, which of course finds its logical conclusion in the various tools online readers have to share what we&#8217;ve been [reading](http://del.icio.us) (or [watching](http://youtube.com), or [listening to](http://www.last.fm/), or [thinking about](http://blogspot.com), or, oh yeah, [knitting](http://www.flickr.com/groups/knitting/pool/ "crazy for knitting flickr pool")). Ok, it might find its logical conclusion in [book clubs](http://bookblog.net/bbarchives/000311.html "at least this is a blogged book club"), but that&#8217;s not nearly as much fun for pondering.
