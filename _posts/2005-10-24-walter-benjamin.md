I was thinking tonight in class that [Walter Benjamin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin "wikipedia article")&#8216;s &#8220;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&#8221; was a nice, simplistic way of grounding [Derrida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrida "wikipedia article")&#8216;s repetitive abstractions in _Of Grammatology_. My professor was a little underwhelmed at the idea of simplifying things, and wanted to talk about _Paradise Lost_ instead, but&#8230;the impossibility of an original piece of artwork having its aura of originality without the existence of its lithographs is a really concrete example of the endless reciprocity of the relationship between signifier and signified.

It&#8217;s so simple. This my problem with Derrida. His concepts are all so logical and intuitive that it seems like they should&#8217;ve gone unsaid (and the man said a good deal about these things). Maybe his legacy on the academic consciousness has rendered reading him virtually unnecessary. Maybe Nietzche said it all a heck of a lot more elegantly.

But the Benjamin essay is a little easier to have fun with. I haven&#8217;t read it in a few years, but I have to wonder what some media studies Ph.D. candidates might dreaming up by combining Benjamin with internet memes. Links to a blog post on other blogs are signifiers that add a similar aura of the original to the post to which they link, yes?

But then, _Mona Lisa_ doesn&#8217;t have a hunk of [technorati](http://www.technorati.com) javascript listing all known lithographs underneath her frame at the Louvre.
