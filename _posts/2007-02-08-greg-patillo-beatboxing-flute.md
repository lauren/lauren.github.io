[Greg Patillo](http://www.myspace.com/pattillostyle "myspace profile") must have the strongest diaphragm in the known universe. I used to play the flute and I can assure you, this would not be easy.

I liked this version of the [_Inspector Gadget_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget "wikipedia article") theme (how much would I have once _totally_ killed for Penny&#8217;s watch?) even better than his cover of the [Super Mario Brothers theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crfrKqFp0Zg) that [everyone&#8217;s talking about](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/06/super_mario_theme_on.html "boing boing post").

Go, go Gadget [Embrouchure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embouchure)!
