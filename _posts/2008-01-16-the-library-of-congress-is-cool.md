[The Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/index.html) has [a flickr account!](http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress) _[via [metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/68229/The-Library-of-Congress-on-Flickr)]_ With awesome photos from their archives! And no copyright restrictions!

I&#8217;m their new biggest fan.

From your favorite federal institution&#8217;s [flickr profile](http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress):

> **Yes. We really are THE Library of Congress.**  
> We invite your tags and comments! Identifying information is also appreciated&#8211;many of our old photos came to us with very little description.

How sweet!

Some notable NYC photos:
