So here&#8217;s a [cool MosNews article](http://www.mosnews.com/feature/2005/10/10/bloggingpredicted.shtml) about how [Vladimir Odoevsky](http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=CornwellVladimir "online bookstore bio"), a 19th-century Russian prince, predicted blogging in his novel _Year 4338_. An interesting excerpt from an unidentified translation of the novel:

> The job of publishing such a journal daily or weekly is carried out by the butler. It is done very simply: receiving an order from the masters, he makes a notice of what they tell him, then make copies by camera obscura and sends them to the acquaintances.

Hey, if I had a butler to blog for me, maybe I&#8217;d have a life.

But, um, not only is that quotation completely unreferenced by MosNews&#8230;so is the blog that they supposedly found it in. They claim that the information was blogged by one &#8220;Ivan Dezhurny, a Russian poet and singer&#8221; who is &#8220;generally fond of futuristic literature&#8221; but they _don&#8217;t provide a link to his post or his blog_.

What year is this, MosNews? Link, people! Link to your sources! _That is what hypertext is here for._ Even if it&#8217;s an incomprehensible Russian-language silly-willy LiveJournal. We are curious and we want to see the original right-now-this-very-second live-and-on-our-computer-screen. This is why we&#8217;re using the internet rather than a reference book.

But what&#8217;s really disturbing here is that this &#8220;Ivan Dezhurny&#8221; character is [completely ungoogleable](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ivan+Dezhurny%22) outside of the MosNews article and (as of the time stamp of this post) one referencing site with identical text. Whoever heard of an [ungoogleable](http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,68998,00.html "wired article") blogger? Sure, the _Wired_ article hints at the possibility of blogging anonymously or under an assumed name, but then, er, wouldn&#8217;t MosNews be calling him his blog name or &#8220;an anonymous blogger&#8221;?

Very mysterious indeed.

**&#1086;&#1073;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1083;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;**&mdash;I think that means &#8220;update&#8221; in Russian.

Well, it&#8217;s been a veritable tempest of Russian visitors and information-providers. First of all, I want to provide some html-ified links to [Ivan Dezhurney&#8217;s original post](http://www.livejournal.com/users/dezhurnyi/43817.html) and an [English-language page](http://www.ralphmag.org/AD/russia-scifi.html) about Prince Odoevsky, both of which [Sergei Rubl&euml;v](http://ssr.livejournal.com/) kindly provided in my html-stunted comments.

I&#8217;m trying to decipher [Sergei&#8217;s recent post](http://www.livejournal.com/users/ssr/1128656.html) with this [rather spiffy online translation app](http://translation2.paralink.com/) and I think what I&#8217;m gathering is that he wrote [this Russian article](http://lenta.ru/news/2005/10/03/odoevsky/) about Odoevsky (quite properly linking to Ivan&#8217;s post) for the [lenta.ru](http://lenta.ru/) news site. I know absolutely nothing about lenta.ru, but, hey, they&#8217;re doing a better job of writing for the web than MosNews.

What I&#8217;m really digging, though, is the text that Sergei used to link to my Odoevsky post: &#1101;&#1090;&#1086;. My online translator renders this back to English as &#8220;it&#8221; and provides &#8220;&#1082;&#1077;&#1085;&#1089;&#1087;&#1077;&#1082;&#1083;&#8221; as the Russian for &#8220;kenspeckle.&#8221; Wonder what made him choose &#1101;&#1090;&#1086;.
