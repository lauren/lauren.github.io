[Kenspeckle](http://kenspeckle.net) must be looking sad lately, because [Hebrew posters](http://kenspeckle.net/blog/2007/02/06/hebrew-posters-zionist-debate/) weren&#8217;t the only tip someone sent me yesterday.

I also got a link to the [Compendium of Lost Words](http://phrontistery.info/clw.html) at [The Phrontistery](http://phrontistery.info/) (also home to the [International House of Logorrhea](http://phrontistery.info/ihlstart.html)) from [Alberto](http://albertocalvo.blogspot.com/) (who also blogs in English [here](http://insidealbion.blogspot.com/)).

Kenspeckle is [part of](http://phrontistery.info/k.html) the International House of Logorrhea, but not the Compendium of Lost Words, which has very [strict membership requirements](http://phrontistery.info/clwdef.html), including:

1. The word must have a header entry in the _Oxford English Dictionary_.
2. The word may not appear in its proper English context on any readily accessible webpage.
3. The word must have been used in Modern English.
4. The word must not be a simple variation in spelling of another word.

These rules raise the natural question of what happens when rabid bloggers and [wordie](http://wordie.org) addicts put these lost words all over their blogs and wordie lists&mdash;do the Compendium&#8217;s rules necessarily write its own oblivion when people find out about it?

Luckily The Phrontistery [faq](http://phrontistery.info/clwfaq.html) states that words that have been picked up here and there by people who read the site don&#8217;t have to be removed. So I don&#8217;t have to be guilty about creating a [compendium favorites list](http://wordie.org/people/kenspeckle?wl=6029) on wordie, including (but not limited to):

  * **alabandical**: barbarous; stupefied from drink
  * **boreism**: behaviour of a boring person
  * **coherentific**: causing to become coherent; causing cohesion
  * **diffibulate**: to unbutton; to unbuckle
  * **epalpebrate**: lacking eyebrows
  * **foppotee**: simpleton
  * **gaudiloquent**: speaking joyfully or on joyful matters
  * **graviloquence**: grave speech
  * **hirquitalliency**: strength of voice
  * **magastromancy**: magical astrology
  * **nubivagant**: moving throughout or among clouds
  * **philargyrist**: lover of money; covetous person
  * **sparsile**: (of a star) not included in any constellation
  * **uglyography**: bad handwriting; poor spelling
