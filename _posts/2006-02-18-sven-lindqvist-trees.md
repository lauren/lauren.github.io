&#8220;Trees raise the sky by being so big and yet having so much further to go. Trees create room.&#8221;&mdash;[Sven Lindqvist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Lindqvist "wikipedia article"), _Exterminate all the Brutes_



I read this book a few years ago and noted in the back that I wanted to write down this quote, but I doubt I ever did. The book&#8217;s really about neocolonialism, but I thought this was a nice tree-appreciative bit.
