Today, what seemed to be a shameless [boingboing plug of useless hipster gear](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/04/17/dirty_dishes_femme_f.html) turned out to be oh-so much more.

The pair of [&#8220;Dirty Dishes&#8221; gloves](http://www.thetartgallery.com/gloves.html) pictured with the post just happend to say &#8220;Miss Spontaneous Combustion&#8221; above the requisite strumpet. The <span class="strike">stalkers</span> curious who&#8217;ve read my [about me page](http://kenspeckle.net/blog/about-lauren-sperber/) might recall that I (though not an outlined pinup on dishwashing gloves) am a sort of a Miss Spontaneous Combustion myself, according to the whimsical votes of high school classmates. But I had never heard of T-H-E Miss Spontaneous Combustion&#8230;

How did I manage all these years to not find out that [Fannie Bell Flemming](http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/strippers/blaze-starr/ "rotten.com timeline"), aka [Blaze Starr](http://webpages.marshall.edu/~booten2/progoff.html "interesting snippets from her diaries"), aka [Miss Spontaneous Combustion](http://www.javasbachelorpad.com/blaze.html "description and photos on Java's Bachelor Pad") was a fiery, red-headed 50s burlesque star&mdash;not just some run-of-the-mill stripper, but a really famous sensation with a [namesake movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096943/ "Blaze") about her political love affair and her own [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Starr) (the pinnacle of fame in my book)! According to rotten.com, she even knew JFK [quite personally](http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/jfk/ "JFK's rotten.com timeline").

Apparently Blaze (heh) was given her name by her first manager, but made it stick by stripping on a burning couch. And she&#8217;s still naughty&mdash;Fannie Bell only retired from stripping at 51 (!) and now owns and manages the [same club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_O'Clock_Club "Two O'Clock Club wikipedia article (stub)") at which she was once the headline stripper. And she [sells jewelry](http://www.blazestarrsgems.com/ "Blaze Starr Gems").

Well. The things you can learn from a pair of dirty dishwashing gloves.
