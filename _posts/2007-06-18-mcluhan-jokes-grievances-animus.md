> One of the things that most people don&#8217;t understand about jokes is that they&#8217;re all grievances. Every joke is a grievance. [&#8230;] These grievance jokes are always getting rid of animus, and when jokes stop, then people are not getting rid of their grievances. 

&mdash;[Marshall McLuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan) on [_The Dick Cavett Show_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dick_Cavett_Show) in 1970 _[via [the &#8220;deeply linked&#8221; box.net widget](http://deeplinking.net/embedding-your-brain-with-box/), which ironically does not permit deeplinking to files it contains]_

See, this is exactly [what I was trying to say](http://kenspeckle.net/blog/2007/03/04/face2face-israel-palestine/). Jokes are the cure to (or, as McLuhan would have it, the exorcist of) all life&#8217;s ills.
