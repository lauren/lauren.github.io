So two weeks ago when [we](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_barcodes_cuecat.php) [were](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/01/googles-newspaper-ads-big-hopes-for-small-barcodes-goog.html) all having a chuckle at [Google](http://google.com) ad sales people&#8217;s surprising faith in the future of scannable barcodes for tracking print ads, I wanted to post a few notable barcode arts & craft projects. As I commented on [Sean&#8217;s post](http://deeplinking.net/scan-this/), geeky artists and are way more likely to increase the virtually nonexistant adoption of barcode cameraphone scanning in the U.S. than&#8230;uh&#8230;_advertising_&mdash;and it&#8217;s still a long shot.

But then I got [extremely distracted](/blog/2008/02/07/support-barack-obama/) by the primaries, so I never posted it. Well, now that Super Tuesday is over and our [hopemonger](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hopemonger) (best new word ever) is finally ahead in the delegate count of everyone except [_The NYT_](http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/delegates/index.html) (which seems to be refusing to count even one more delegate until Hillary starts wining), voil&agrave;!

This awesome [needlepoint](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tikaro/2126492335/in/photostream/) [QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) by [tikaro](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tikaro/) apparently uses [semapedia](http://www.semapedia.org/) to point to the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) article on [pillows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow) _[via [craft](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2007/12/semacode_needlepoint.html)]_.

Flickr user [Magitisa](http://www.flickr.com/photos/crystalginn/) must have an incredible amount of patience, because she [stenciled a QR code onto a cake](http://www.flickr.com/photos/crystalginn/2003491818/) _[also via [craft](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2008/01/qr_code_cake.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954)]_.

In case you forgot what barcodes _used_ to look like, there&#8217;s the non-cameraphone-compatible [Every Barcode](http://www.barcodeart.com/art/digital_frames.html) animation by the barcode-obsessed Scott Blake of [Barcode Art](http://www.barcodeart.com). He&#8217;s got plenty of other barcode goodness, but Every Barcode is definitely the best&mdash;how can you beat a flash animation that cycles through all 10,000,000,000,000 possible barcodes (if you let it run for ten years, that is)?

[![space invaders scarf](/images/2008/02/spaceball-scarf.jpg)](http://lendorff.kaywa.com/)

This [extremely geeky scarf](http://lendorff.kaywa.com/), made by a strange collaboration between British knitwear designers [Office Lendorff](http://www.officelendorff.com/) and &#8220;mobile enthusiasts&#8221; (although it&#8217;s not really clear what they do when not encouraging knitwear enthusiasts to knit QR codes onto scarves) [Kaywa](http://www.kaywa.com/) features a secret QR code knitted below a pixelated [Space Invaders](http://www.spaceinvaders.de/) pattern. According to [one purchaser](http://www.flickr.com/photos/airport-lounge/2124747258/in/pool-qrcodes), the code reads &#8220;insert coin for new life.&#8221;

And, of course you all remember the [previously](http://kenspeckle.net/blog/2005/09/06/eruv-semacode/) kenspeckle [_eRuv_](http://www.dziga.com/eruv/index.php) project, in which [Elliott Malkin](http://dziga.com) bravely plastered the Lower East Side with [semacode](http://www.semacode.org/) posters that pointed to old photographs of the former [Third Avenue El](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Third_Avenue_Line).
