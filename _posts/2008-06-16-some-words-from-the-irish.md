In honor of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday) (which is _today_, if you haven&#8217;t been at an all-day reading of [_Ulysses_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29) like some people), one of the two daily definition/etymology e-newsletters I subscribe to, [wordsmith.org](http://wordsmith.org/)&#8216;s [A.Word.A.Day](http://wordsmith.org/awad/index.html), sent out five words from the Irish last week. They were:

**shebeen** (shuh-BEEN): An unlicensed drinking establishment.

A.Word.A.Day&#8217;s brief etymology: From Irish sibin, diminutive of seibe (mug/mugful). The word
  
is popular in the south of Africa and in Scotland and Ireland.

_The Compact [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oed.com/)_ respectfully disagrees:

> Origin Anglo-Irish; of obscure origin. The ending is Irish _-in_ as in _caubeen_, _colleen_, etc.; an improbably conjecture is that the word is founded on Irish _seapa_, adaption of English shop.

**dornick** (DOR-nik): 1) A piece of rock small enough to throw. 2) Stout linen.

A.Word.A.Day&#8217;s brief etymologies: 1) From Irish dornog (small stone, literally fistful). 2) After Doornik, the name of a Flemish town where the cloth was first manufactured.

_The OED_ notes the name of the Flemish town for the second definition (which is the first definition in its own listing) and provides no etymology for the first definition (its second).

**hubbub** (HUB-ub): Excited fuss or tumult of a crowd.

A.Word.A.Day&#8217;s brief etymology: Perhaps from Irish ubub (an interjection of contempt).

_The OED_&#8216;s definition is more certain:

> In the 16th century _hooboube_, _-boobe_, often referred to as an Irish outcry, and probably representing some Irish expression. Cf. Gaelic _ub! ub! ubub!_ an interjection of aversion or contempt; _abu!_ the war-cry of the ancient Irish.

**cosher** (KOSH-uhr): To pamper.

A.Word.A.Day&#8217;s brief etymology: From Irish cosair (feast).

_OED_ etymology: Phonetic representation of Irish _coisir_ feast, feasting, entertainment. Also notable is _The OED_&#8216;s different definition of cosher:

> 1) To feast, to live at free quarters upon dependants or kinsmen. 2) To treat with indulgent fondness, pamper; to cocker or coddle.

**smithereens** (smith-uh-REENZ): Tiny fragments.

A.Word.A.Day&#8217;s brief etymology: Probably from Irish smidirin, diminutive of smiodar (fragment).

_OED_ sez:

> Variation of smithers [which it lists as &#8220;of obscure origin&#8221;], with Irish diminutive ending, and either adopted from, or the source of modified Irish _smidir&iacute;n_. 

The disagreement between Wordsmith and _The OED_ on a few of these reminded me of the controversy over Daniel Cassidy&#8217;s [_How the Irish Invented Slang: The Secret Language of the Crossroads_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHow-Irish-Invented-Slang-Counterpunch%2Fdp%2F1904859607%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1213664915%26sr%3D8-1&tag=kenspeckle-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325). I heard Cassidy present the book at the [Irish Arts Center](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=245134539) (the [actual website](http://www.irishartscenter.org/) for which seems to be down) and will begrudgingly admit to being pretty impressed (hey, I don&#8217;t know Gaelic for shit!) until Grant Barrett&#8217;s [excellent blog post](http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/grantbarrett/comments/humdinger_of_a_bad_irish_scholar/) schooled me on the matter.

Anyway, happy Bloomsday everyone. Time to read a chapter of _Ulysses_&mdash;I dare you!
