A colleague of mine recently alerted me to the wonderous Latin phrase _Johannes factotum_, meaning a Jack of all trades with the bonus connotation of &#8220;would-be universal genius&#8221; that the phrase &#8220;Jack of all trades&#8221; most certainly lacks. The [_OED Online_](http://www.oed.com) entry for factotum elaborates:

> **a.** In L. phrases: _Dominus factotum_, used for &#8216;one who controls everything,&#8217; a ruler with uncontrolled power; _Johannes factotum_, a Jack of all trades, a would-be universal genius. Also _fig._   
> **b.** One who meddles with everything, a busybody.   
> **c.** In mod. sense: A man of all-work; also, a servant who has the entire management of his master&#8217;s affairs.

Gotta love how the _OED_&#8216;s idea of a &#8220;modern&#8221; sense of a word can include the concept of servant and master.

Anyway, the first instance of _Johannes factotum_ in the English (according to the _OED_ anyway) is in [Robert Greene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greene "wikipedia article")&#8216;s (doubtfully attributed) pamphlet, [_Groatsworth of Wit_](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/%7Erbear/greene1.html "online text"), in which he calls Shakespeare &#8220;an absolute _Johannes fac totum_, [who] is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey.&#8221; Shake-scene. Heh.

By the way, since I didn&#8217;t know what the heck groatsworth meant, the _OED_ defines it as &#8220;As much as is bought or sold for a groat&#8221;&mdash;noting off-handedly that the figurative use of such would be &#8220;a very small amount.&#8221; Thanks, _OED_. Until tomorrow.
