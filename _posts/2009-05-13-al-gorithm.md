My fave project in the [ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/) [Spring Show](http://itp.nyu.edu/shows/spring2009/) last night was definitely AL-gorithm by [Alex Kaufmann](http://chinaalbino.com/alex/) <span class="strike">(seemingly unlinkable)</span>.

Wanting to experience language the way a computer does&mdash;as meaningless packets of information&mdash;Alex printed up 22 copies of his favorite passage of [_All the King&#8217;s Men_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_King%27s_Men) and cut out all but every instance of a single letter on each sheet.

The finished product is 22 sheets of paper with seemingly random placements of a single letter that create the full passage when stacked on top of each other in any order.

The very best thing about this project&mdash;aside from the [Brian Dettmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dettmer)-esque OCD required to complete it&mdash;is that it&#8217;s basically the opposite of [Raymond Queneau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Queneau)&#8216;s _[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Thousand_Billion_Poems)_ (see this great [interactive version](http://www.bevrowe.info/Poems/QueneauRandom.htm)). Each unit of _Hundred Thousand Billion Poems_ has its own meaning, but reordering the strips destroys the original meaning of the original poem (and rarely produces new coherent meaning)&mdash;and in AL-gorithm each page has no human-decipherable meaning, but reordering them preserves the original text. Cool!

The only thing it needs is a better title. How &#8217;bout a quote from Queneau? &#8220;Oh reader thinking thus your heart will lock.&#8221;
