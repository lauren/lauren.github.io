Wow, there are way more barcode fans out there than previously imagined!

As a follow-up to [barcode arts & crafts](http://kenspeckle.net/blog/2008/02/13/barcode-arts-crafts/), here are some of the interesting links I received in response:

Roger from the QR code-obsessed London-based site [2d code](http://2d-code.co.uk/) sent me this hilarious video from [The Voice of the Street](http://www.thevoiceofthestreet.com/) explaining how their project, which gives street artists QR codes, is supposed to work. Get a load of the voiceover.

And Jerry of [Bar Code Nerds](http://barcodenerds.blogspot.com/) (tagline: &#8220;Yep. Not only do we admit it, we&#8217;re damn proud of it.&#8221;) sent me a link to his [massive online collection](http://www.jetcityorange.com/barcodes/art/) of old-school barcode graffiti and art, including this awesome picture of a print (I think?) called [spaceball](http://www.jetcityorange.com/barcodes/art/art_3.html) by someone named AlmaZ.

Closet barcode lovers, take heart. Kindred spirits abound on the WWWs.
